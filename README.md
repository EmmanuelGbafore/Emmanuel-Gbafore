- 👋 Hi, I’m @Emmanuel Gbafore.
- I'm an enthusiastic learner enrolled in the 16-week Power Learn Program, a comprehensive software development course. Passionate about web technologies, Python, and Dart with Flutter, I am exploring the foundations of software development and actively participating in FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.  Simultaneously, I'm gaining valuable insights into database management using SQL. A deep passion for coding drives me and I am excited about the opportunities to learn and grow in the dynamic world of technology. When I am not coding you can find me enjoying a book, nature adventure, or testing out a new recipe in the kitchen.
